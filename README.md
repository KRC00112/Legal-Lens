LegalLens is a text summarization app written in Java for the main purpose of summarizing legal Bills. The backend for the app runs on a Flask server which can be operated on the local system itself. No summarization will take place without starting the server first. The dataset used for this text summarization is called [BillSum](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00523). As of right now, we have trained two models upon it: [Pegasus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08777) and [Longformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150). (Currently still in development process)
