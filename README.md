LegalLens is a text summarization app written in Java for the main purpose of summarizing legal Bills. The backend for the app runs on a flask server which can be operated on the local system itself. No summarization will take place without starting the server. The database used for this text summariazion is called [BillSum]https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00523. and as of right now we have trained two models upon it.
